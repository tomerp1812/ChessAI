# ChessAI
play chess against an AI

This project in progress.

Right now the game in his first steps.
What I've done so far:
- built the game structure: the board and pieces in right places.
- enabled basic moves and captures (which removes pieces from the board)
- enabled casteling
  
What's next:
- finish all the legal moves, such as en passant, promotion of pawns
- disable moves that expose the king
- finishing of a game
- build first and simple AI
- create more sophisticated AI
