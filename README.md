# ChessAI
play chess against an AI

This project in progress.

Almost finishing completely the game.
What I've done so far:
- built the game structure: the board and pieces in right places.
- enabled basic moves and captures (which removes pieces from the board)
- enabled casteling
- finish all the legal moves, such as en passant, promotion of pawns
- disable moves that expose the king
- finishing of a game on checkmate or stalemate
- give the player the options of promoting to different pieces other than queen
- add 3 move repetition rule, and 50 move with no capturing or moving a pawn rule, both make the game end in a draw
- built opponent that randomally moves

What's next:
- create more sophisticated AI
- give players the option to pick to play each other, or against a computer (hopfully with different levels)
